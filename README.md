# Automated Essay Scoring

The project goal is to create a model that is able to do Automated Essay Scoring

This data set is from Kaggle sponsored by the The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (Hewlett) link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes



Project can be seen in the Jupyternote book File Final Project AES CS160P

The Phases are:
1.Introductory Phase
2. Preprocess Phase
3. Feature Engineering Phase
4. Training Model Phase

and after is the results
the metrics used to judge the model are the Mean Square Error, Variance Score and the Cophen Kappa Score

The models tested are
1. Linear Regression Model
2. Logistic Model
3. Decision Tree Classifier
